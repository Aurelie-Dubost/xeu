### Create a Voila app for monitoring the market with customizable parameters for the underlying asset, start date, and end date

Retrieve Market Data Function: Create a Python function to fetch data from Yahoo Finance. This function should take the underlying symbol, start date, and end date as input parameters.

Voila App Structure: Set up a Voila app with an interactive interface. The first line of the app will contain input widgets for the user to customize the underlying symbol, start date, and end date.

Tabs for Returns: Implement tabs in the app to display daily, weekly, monthly, and year-to-date (YTD) returns. Each tab will show a chart or a table representing the respective returns.

Automatic Refresh: Ensure that the tabs and charts are automatically refreshed when any of the input parameters (underlying, start date, end date) are changed.

Deployment: Deploy the app using Voila.

Let's start by creating the Python function to fetch market data. We will use yfinance, a popular library for fetching historical market data from Yahoo Finance.
