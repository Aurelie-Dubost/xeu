Subject: Urgent Appointment Request

Dear [Recipientâ€™s Name],

I am writing to inform you that, according to the opinions of three different practitioners, I have a dental infection that requires a root canal treatment within the next two days to prevent the extraction of an incisor. Given the urgency of the situation, I would like to schedule an appointment as soon as possible.

I am available at any time and willing to adjust to your schedule for this procedure.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
