Subject: Request for Urgent Dental Appointment

Dear [Recipientâ€™s Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

Following consultations with three practitioners, it has been advised that I undergo a root canal treatment within the next two days to prevent the extraction of an incisor. I am writing to request an appointment at your earliest convenience to address this matter.

I am flexible and can adjust my schedule to accommodate your earliest available slot.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
